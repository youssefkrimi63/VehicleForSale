# VehicleForSale

 a web application for selling vehicles that utilizes Python and the Flask web framework with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python

























 created the application using Flask and Python, implementing basic CRUD operations such as delete, edit, and show. I also incorporated many-to-many relationships and added features like a like button.

Firstly, the application starts with a login and register page where users can input their information. Upon registration, users are directed to the dashboard. In the dashboard, users can view all vehicles for sale, add their own vehicle listings, delete or update them, and like other vehicles. Additionally, users can view vehicle and user information, and update their own profile information.
